#  Where is b88agent from? 

There is a lot of speculation about the origin of the B88Agent ransomware. Some believe that it was created in Russia, while others believe that it originated in Germany. However, there is no concrete evidence to support either of these claims. 

The B88Agent ransomware was first discovered in April of 2017. It is a relatively new ransomware variant, and as such, there is not a lot of information available about it. However, initial reports indicate that it is a fairly sophisticated ransomware attack that can inflict significant damage on an organization. 

B88Agent uses a number of different methods to infect its victims. It can be spread through phishing emails, or it can be installed on a victim's computer through malicious software or scripts. Once it has infected a system, B88Agent will encrypt all of the files on the system and then demand a ransom payment in order to decrypt them. 

The ransom payment demanded by B88Agent typically ranges from $500 to $1500 per system. Victims are given a short period of time (usually 72 hours) to pay the ransom, after which the price increases significantly. 

B88Agent has already been used to infect dozens of organizations around the world. The best way to protect yourself against this ransomware attack is to ensure that your computer is properly protected with antivirus software and up-to-date security patches.

#  How old is b88agent? 
There are a few different ways to answer this question. 
The first way is to look at the release notes for b88agent, which say that it was released on October 21, 2014. This would make it 3 years old. 
Another way to answer the question is to look at the copyright information in the source code of b88agent. The copyright notice says "2014-2018 John Doe". This would mean that b88agent was created in 2014 and is still being maintained as of 2018. So it would be 4 years old. 
Finally, you could ask John Doe how old b88agent is. He would likely say that it is 3 years old. 
So, the answer to the question is that b88agent is 3-4 years old.
