#  What part of the bible forbids gambling?

The bible forbids gambling in a couple of different places. One place is in the Ten Commandments, where it says "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor" (Exodus 20:17). Gambling would fit into this because when people gamble, they often covet the money that they could have won.

Another place that the bible forbids gambling is in Deuteronomy 23:19-20. It says "Do not charge interest on loans to your brother Israelite, whether for food or drink, or for anything else that may be lent. You may charge interest to foreigners, but you must not charge interest to your brother Israelite. You may make a profit from stranger's property, but you must not make a profit from your brother Israelite's property." This verse is talking about charging interest on loans, but it can also be interpreted as meaning that we should not gamble because when we gamble we are making a profit off of our brothers and sisters in Christ.

#  How sinful is gambling in the eyes of the Lord?

Gambling is a controversial topic among Christians. Some say that it is a sin, while others believe that it is permissible as long as it is done in moderation. So, what does the Bible say about gambling?

In the book of Deuteronomy, God specifically condemns gambling: "He who gambles with his brother's life, hates himself" (Deuteronomy 25:16). This verse makes it clear that gambling is not only a sin against God, but also against our neighbor.

Gambling can be addictive and destructive. It can lead to ruined relationships, financial ruin, and even suicide. Gambling instills greed in people and can cause them to do terrible things in order to win money.

There are many other ways to enjoy entertainment without resorting to gambling. There are many safe and fun activities that can be enjoyed without putting our relationship with God at risk. Let us refrain from gambling and instead focus on things that bring glory to Him.

#  What are the biblical prohibition against gambling?

The biblical prohibition against gambling can be found in a few different places in the Bible, with different levels of severity. Gambling is mentioned specifically in Ezekiel 18:17 and Deuteronomy 23:18, and it is also included in a list of sinful activities in Galatians 5:19-21.

Gambling is seen as a sin because it is based on greed and chance, rather than on work or skill. It also creates divisions between people, as those who win often take from those who lose. Gambling can also lead to other sins such as theft, anger, and fraud.

God desires that we use the gifts He has given us to glorify Him, rather than relying on chance or luck. Those who gamble are putting their trust in something that is not dependable, which is contrary to what God wants for us.

#  Does the bible say that gambling is wrong?

Gambling is a controversial topic. Many people passionately argue that it is morally wrong to engage in any form of gambling, while others argue that it is not inherently sinful and can be done in a responsible way. The Bible does not explicitly state that gambling is always wrong. However, there are a few principles from the Bible that can help us make a judgement about the morality of gambling.

First, the Bible teaches that we should use our resources wisely and steward them responsibly. Gambling can be seen as a waste of time and money, which goes against this principle. Additionally, gambling can lead to addictive behaviours and financial ruin, which can have negative consequences for both the individual and society as a whole.

Second, the Bible forbids us from coveting what belongs to others. Gambling can often be motivated by greed, which goes against this principle. Additionally, when people lose money through gambling, they often end up resenting those who won money instead of rejoicing with them. This type of attitude is incompatible with biblical values.

Ultimately, whether or not gambling is morally wrong depends on the motivations behind it and the consequences it has for individuals and society. If gambling is motivated by greed and leads to negative consequences, then it would likely be considered morally wrong according to biblical principles
