#  Blackjack Takes On A New Twist In OutlanderThoreau!

As if traveling back in time wasn't adventurous enough, Outlander fans were introduced to a new type of Blackjack during Season 3. Dubbed "Thoreau", the game is played with a regular deck of cards and 2 Jokers. The object of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible, with the lowest score winning.

The Joker is wild and can be used as any other card in the deck. A player's score is determined by adding the values of their cards together. Face cards are worth 10 points each, aces are worth 1 point, and all other cards are worth their number value. For example, if you are dealt an ace and a two, your score would be 3 points (1+2=3).

Outlander characters Jamie and Claire stumbled upon Thoreau while gambling at Fergus' casino in France. Jamie was initially hesitant to try the new game, but Claire was eager to give it a go. She ended up winning the first hand she played!

Whether you're a fan of Outlander or just enjoy playing Blackjack, Thoreau is definitely worth giving a try. It's easy to learn and offers plenty of excitement for players looking for something new.

Casinos have always been a fun place to spend some time, and with online casinos, the experience can be even better. You can enjoy all your favorite casino games from the comfort of your home, and you never have to worry about leaving your comfortable chair.

One of the most popular casino games is blackjack, and there are many different versions of this game available online. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, you will be able to find a blackjack game that suits your needs. If you want to learn more about blackjack before playing for real money, there are many free demo versions of the game available online.

When choosing an online casino to play at, it is important to do your research first. Not all casinos are created equal, and some offer better bonuses and payouts than others. It is also important to make sure that the casino you choose is reputable and trustworthy. There are many scams out there, so it is important to only deal with well-known and trusted casinos.

Once you have chosen a casino, it is time to make your first deposit. Most casinos will offer a welcome bonus for new players, which can give you a head start in your gaming sessions. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of the bonus before accepting it, as there may be wagering requirements that must be met before you can withdraw any winnings.

Once you have deposited money into your account, you can start playing any of the games offered by the casino. Blackjack is one of the most popular games for good reason – it is simple to learn but offers plenty of opportunity for strategy and skill. If you are new to blackjack, be sure to take advantage of the many helpful tutorials and guides that are available online.

Blackjack can be played with any number of decks (from one up to eight), and each deck has 52 cards in it. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a blackjack), or by making the dealer go bust by getting more points than they have. You can also draw additional cards in order to try and get closer to 21 without going over.

The best way to improve your chances of winning at blackjack is by practicing regularly. Many online casinos offer free play options so that you can try out new strategies without risking any real money. This is also a good way to familiarize yourself with different variants of the game before playing for real money bets.

If you like excitement and adrenaline rushes then blackjack is certainly the game for you! With its fast-paced action, thrilling wins and losses, and occasional streaks of bad luck, blackjack provides endless hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels
