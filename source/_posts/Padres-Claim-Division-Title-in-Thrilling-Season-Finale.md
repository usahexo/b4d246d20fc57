The Padres completed an improbable run to the division title, capped by a 3-2 victory in the season finale over the Dodgers.

The team was led by MVP candidate Manny Machado, who hit 37 home runs and drove in 107 runs. Other key contributors included first baseman Eric Hosmer (25 homers, 94 RBI) and starting pitcher Joey Lucchesi (12-9, 3.30 ERA).

The Padres will now face the Braves in the NLDS. The series is scheduled to begin Thursday night in Atlanta.

#  San Diego Padres Are One of Baseball's Most Improved Teams

This offseason, the San Diego Padres have made a number of moves that have improved their ball club.

Some observers are predicting that the Padres will be one of the teams to beat in baseball this season.

The Padres boast a lineup that is young and talented, with plenty of potential to succeed. The team also has a number of top pitchers who could help them to win games.

One of the keys to the Padres' success this season is their strong bullpen. Led by Kirby Yates and Craig Stammen, the bullpen is sure to be a major strength for the team.

Another factor that could help the Padres is their manager, Andy Green. Green is considered to be one of the best managers in baseball, and he is sure to provide leadership and direction for the team.

The Padres will face some tough competition this season, but they are certainly capable of winning games against any team in baseball. With a little bit of luck and some good play from their talented players, the Padres could very well make it to the playoffs this year.
