The film begins with Bond abseiling into Metropolitan Police headquarters in London to shoot M (Judi Dench), who has been held hostage and tortured by Le Chiffre in an attempt to coerce her into giving him inside information on British intelligence operations. In one scene, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) dons a black evening gown and poses as a femme fatale card dealer at Casino Royale in Montenegro to tempt Bond away from playing poker.

The basic plot of Casino Royale is that Vesper Lynd recruits James Bond onto behalf of Her Majesty's Secret Service when some terrorists funded through crime boss Le Chiffre plan on blowing up an airplane full of people going on vacation unless they get a large sum of money from him - which would bankrupt him - so she sends 007 in undercover because she knows he can bluff very convincingly (given how often he does it). Along with him goes Felix Leiter who teams up with Bond again after having last worked together during Operation Jedburgh where they stopped some Nazis codenamed Moonraker trying to weaponize V1 rockets. So this movie combines two different arcs which have intersected before but here their paths finally cross: one involving terrorism financing, greed and double-crossing; ***********************************************************************************************
