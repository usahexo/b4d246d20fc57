#  Arizona Diamondbacks Beat Los Angeles Dodgers in Opener

The Arizona Diamondbacks kicked off their season with a victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 3-2. The Diamondbacks were led by A.J. Pollock, who had two hits and an RBI.

Zack Greinke started for the Diamondbacks and went six innings, allowing two runs on six hits while striking out six. He was helped out by the bullpen, which pitched three scoreless innings to secure the win.

For the Dodgers, Clayton Kershaw started and went five innings, allowing three runs on six hits while striking out seven. The bullpen allowed one run in four innings of relief.

The Diamondbacks will look to build on their opening day win when they face the Dodgers again on Saturday.

#  Colorado Rockies Look to Challenge Dodgers and Giants in NL West

The Colorado Rockies have made some big moves in the offseason, most notably signing Ian Desmond to play first base. They also acquired Carlos Gonzalez from the Athletics and Greg Holland from the Royals. These acquisitions, along with their young talent, make them a team to watch in the National League West.

The Dodgers are still the favorites in the division after winning 91 games last season. But the Giants are not far behind, and with a healthy Madison Bumgarner, they could be contenders as well. The Padres and Diamondbacks are both rebuilding teams, so it is likely that the Rockies will be battling for second place in the division this year.

The Rockies' offense should be one of the best in baseball this year. Their lineup includes Desmond, Nolan Arenado, Charlie Blackmon, David Dahl, Gerardo Parra, and Gonzalez. Desmond had a down year last season with the Nationals but is coming into this season fresh and motivated. Arenado is one of the best third baseman in baseball and led the Rockies in batting average (.287), home runs (41), and RBIs (133) last year. Blackmon was also a force for Colorado last season, batting .324 with 29 home runs and 82 RBIs.

Their pitching staff is less impressive but still has some solid starters. Jon Gray had a good rookie season last year andTyler Chatwood had an All-Star campaign in 2013 but struggled last year. Holland will be a welcome addition to their bullpen after leading the league with 41 saves last season.

If their new players can live up to their potential and Bumgarner stays healthy, then the Rockies have a good chance of finishing in second place or even first place in the NL West this year.

#  Clayton Kershaw Looks to Lead LA Dodgers to 4th Straight NL West Title

Clayton Kershaw has been one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball for the last several seasons. This year, he looks to lead the LA Dodgers to their fourth straight NL West title.

Kershaw had a bit of an off year in 2016, but he still finished with a very respectable 14-9 record and 2.31 ERA. He is looking to bounce back this season and lead the Dodgers to another division championship.

The Dodgers have a very talented lineup, and they should be able to compete with any team in the National League. Kershaw will be a key part of their success this season.

If Kershaw can stay healthy and pitch like he is capable of, the Dodgers should be headed to the playoffs again this year. He is definitely one of the top pitchers in baseball, and he could lead his team to a deep run in the playoffs.

#  San Francisco Giants Chasing Down LA Dodgers for NL West Supremacy

The Los Angeles Dodgers have been the class of the National League West for the past few years. But this season, the San Francisco Giants are making a serious run at catching them.

The Giants currently sit just 3.5 games back of the Dodgers in the NL West standings. They have been hot lately, winning 8 of their last 10 games.

One of the key reasons for the Giants' resurgence has been the play of their starting pitchers. Led by Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto, the Giants' starting rotation has been one of the best in baseball this season.

Bumgarner has been on an absolute tear lately. He is 5-0 with a 1.13 ERA in his last six starts. Cueto has also been playing well, going 5-1 with a 2.84 ERA in his last eight starts.

If the Giants can keep up their hot play, they have a good chance of overtaking the Dodgers for first place in the NL West.

#  Seattle Mariners Hope to Ride Young Stars to Victory in NL West

The Seattle Mariners had a pretty good season in 2017, finishing with an 86-76 record and narrowly missing the playoffs. This year, the Mariners are looking to build on that success by riding their young stars to victory in the NL West.

One of the biggest reasons for the Mariners' optimism is the emergence of 23-year-old outfielder Mitch Haniger. Haniger was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks prior to last season and made an immediate impact, batting .282 with 16 homers and 52 RBIs in 117 games. Haniger is off to an even better start this year, hitting .341 with six homers and 15 RBIs in 19 games.

Another key player for Seattle is 24-year-old shortstop Jean Segura. Segura was acquired from the Milwaukee Brewers prior to last season and had a breakout year, batting .319 with 20 homers and 102 RBIs in 158 games. Segura is also off to a hot start this year, batting .356 with four homers and 14 RBIs in 19 games.

Other young players who could play a big role for the Mariners this season include 25-year-old third baseman Kyle Seager, 26-year-old first baseman Ryon Healy, and 24-year-old starting pitcher Marco Gonzales.

The Mariners will have their work cut out for them if they hope to unseat the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, but with their talented young roster, they definitely have a chance.
