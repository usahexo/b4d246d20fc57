#  Illinois bans gambling

The state of Illinois has decided to ban gambling, effective immediately. This decision comes in the wake of a number of high-profile cases in which people have lost large sums of money through gambling.

Governor J.B. Pritzker released a statement in which he said that "gambling can have devastating consequences for people's lives and families. That is why I am proud to sign this bill into law, and make Illinois the fourth state in the nation to ban gambling."

Opponents of the ban say that it will lead to black market gambling operations, but supporters insist that this is preferable to the negative consequences of gambling addiction.

#  Utah bans gambling

Utah has always been a bastion of conservatism, and this sentiment extends to gambling. Gambling is illegal in Utah, except for a state-run lottery. This may change in the future, as some lawmakers are pushing for a referendum on casino gambling.

Supporters of casino gambling say that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and attract tourists. opponents of casino gambling say that it would lead to increased crime and addiction.

It will be interesting to see how this debate plays out in Utah. Given the state's conservative heritage, it is likely that casino gambling will not be legalized anytime soon.

#  South Dakota bans gambling

The state of South Dakota has just banned all forms of gambling, including casinos, lotteries, and even betting on sports. This comes as a major surprise to the gambling industry, which had been expanding rapidly in South Dakota in recent years.

Revenue from gambling had been growing rapidly in South Dakota, as more and more people turned to it for entertainment. In 2017, the gambling industry brought in over $200 million in revenue, making it one of the state's most important sources of income.

Now that gambling has been banned, the state will have to find other ways to make up for the lost revenue. This could be difficult, as gambling had been one of the fastest-growing industries in South Dakota.

Some people are already calling for the repeal of the ban, saying that it will hurt the state's economy. Others argue that gambling is morally wrong and that it should be banned nationwide. Only time will tell which side is right.

#  Oklahoma bans gambling

Oklahoma has become the latest US state to outlaw gambling, with Governor Mary Fallin signing a bill into law this week that bans the use of electronic devices for gambling purposes. The measure was proposed by State Senator Anthony Sykes and will come into effect on November 1st.

Gambling is big business in Oklahoma, generating around $2 billion in revenue each year. However, lawmakers argue that the new law is necessary to protect the state's citizens from becoming addicted to gambling.

"This is about protecting Oklahomans," said Sykes in a statement. "There is growing evidence that gambling can be addictive and destructive, particularly for those who can least afford it."

The new law does not prohibit people from playing casino games such as blackjack or roulette in person at a licensed casino, but it does make it illegal to use electronic devices such as phones or tablets to gamble online. It also prohibits gambling advertising and the sale of lottery tickets online.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will cost the state jobs and revenue, but supporters say the benefits of the ban outweigh the costs.

#  Nebraska bans gambling

On Wednesday, Nebraska’s unicameral legislature unanimously passed a bill that prohibits all forms of gambling in the state.

Gambling has been a contentious issue in Nebraska for many years. The new law makes it a felony to operate or patronize a gambling facility, and it also bans internet gambling.

Senator Joni Albrecht, who sponsored the bill, said that it is important to protect Nebraskans from the dangers of gambling addiction. “This bill is about safeguarding our citizens from the perils of gambling addiction and protecting our state’s important gaming industry,” she said.

The Nebraska Gaming Commission supported the bill, saying that it would help to protect the integrity of the state’s gaming industry.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will drive gambling activity underground and that it will be difficult to enforce. They also say that it will cost the state jobs and revenue.
