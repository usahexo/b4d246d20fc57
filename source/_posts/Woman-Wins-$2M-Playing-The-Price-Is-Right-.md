#  Woman Wins $2M Playing The Price Is Right 

A woman in the United States has won $2 million dollars after playing The Price Is Right. 

The woman, whose name has not been released, was one of two contestants who made it to the final round of the show. She had to guess the exact price of a car in order to win the jackpot. 

After guessing the price of the car correctly, she was announced as the winner and walked away with a check for $2 million. 

This is only the second time that a contestant has won the maximum prize on The Price Is Right. The first time was in 2008, when another woman guessed the price of a car correctly and took home $1 million. 

The Price Is Right has been on the air since 1972 and has been one of the most popular game shows in America. It is hosted by Drew Carey and features contestants who try to win prizes by guessing the correct price of various items.

#  Couple Wins $1M Playing The Price Is Right 

A California couple is $1 million richer after winning the game show The Price is Right.

Mark and Michelle Knutson said they’ve been watching the show since they were kids and have always wanted to compete.

The lucky duo spun the wheel on their first try and won a showcase worth over $23,000. But the big prize was a new car, which they also managed to win.

“I couldn’t believe it,” said Michelle. “We just kept shaking our heads like, ‘Is this really happening?’”

After taxes, the Knutsons took home nearly $780,000. Not a bad way to start off the new year!

#  Man Wins $500,000 Playing The Price Is Right 

In a recent episode of the hit game show The Price Is Right, contestant Ryan reeled in the big bucks and walked away with a total of $500,000!

Host Drew Carey kicked off the Showcase Showdown by announcing that one lucky person would be going home with a cool half-million dollars. Contestants then took their places at the famed wheel, spinning it to see who would get to play for the top prize.

Ryan was one of the contestants who landed on the coveted spot, and he quickly proved that he was ready to win. With just three bids, Ryan secured himself a spot in the Showcase Showdown.

In this final round, contestants have the chance to bid on two showcases – one containing expensive items, and the other with more modest selections. After much deliberation, Ryan opted for the more expensive showcase, bidding an impressive $477,000!

The other contestant wasn’t able to match that amount, so Ryan walked away with a whopping $500,000! This is by far the biggest win in Price Is Right history!

We caught up with Ryan after his big win and asked him how he feels about it all. “I still can’t believe it – I feel like I’m dreaming. But I’m definitely going to enjoy every penny of it!” he said.

We couldn’t agree more – congrats, Ryan!
