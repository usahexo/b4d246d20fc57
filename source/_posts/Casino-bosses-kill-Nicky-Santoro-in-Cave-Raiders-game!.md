#  Casino bosses kill Nicky Santoro in Cave Raiders game!

Casino bosses were caught up in a fury yesterday when it was revealed that they had arranged the killing of Nicky Santoro, an enforcer for the mob, in a Cave Raiders game.

Nicky Santoro was known for his brutal tactics and had been muscling in on the casino bosses' profits. In order to protect their business interests, the casino bosses decided to take him out.

They hired a team of developers to create a game that would trap Santoro and kill him. The game's mechanics were designed so that Santoro would be unable to escape, and he was eventually killed by a cave-in.

The casino bosses are now facing charges for conspiracy to commit murder, but they insist that they had no choice but to take out Santoro. They say that he was a threat to their business and that they had no other way to deal with him.

Nicky Santoro, one of the most popular and controversial mobsters in Las Vegas history has been killed by casino bosses in the new Cave Raiders game!

Santoro, who was played by actor Joe Pesci in the hit movie "Casino" was beaten to death with a baseball bat in the new game released by Slot Studios.

The game, which is set in a casino Underworld, has caused outrage among Santoro's fans who have accused the casino of using virtual reality to recreate his murder.
