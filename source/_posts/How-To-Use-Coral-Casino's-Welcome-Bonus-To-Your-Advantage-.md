#  How To Use Coral Casino's Welcome Bonus To Your Advantage 

If you're a fan of online gambling, there's a good chance you've heard of Coral Casino. This casino is one of the biggest and most popular in the world, and it offers players an excellent range of games to choose from.

What's more, Coral Casino also offers a generous welcome bonus to new players. This bonus can be worth up to £200, and it's an excellent way to get your gambling adventure off to a great start.

But how can you make the most of this bonus? And what should you watch out for? Here are some tips on how to use Coral Casino's welcome bonus to your advantage:

1. Make sure you meet the wagering requirements. One thing to watch out for with any casino bonus is the wagering requirements. These are the terms and conditions that dictate how you can use your bonus money. In most cases, you'll need to playthrough (or wager) your bonus money a certain number of times before you can withdraw any winnings. So make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully so that you know exactly what you need to do in order to clear your bonus.

2. Use the bonus money on high-value games. Another thing to bear in mind is that not all games contribute equally towards meeting the wagering requirements. For example, slots tend to contribute more than table games like blackjack or roulette. So if you want to make the most of your bonus money, it's wise to use it on high-value games like slots rather than low-risk games like blackjack.

3. Take advantage of bonuses on other products too. Coral Casino offers its players plenty of other bonuses as well, not just the welcome bonus. So be sure to check out what's on offer and see if there are any other bonuses that might interest you. You could potentially score yourself some free spins or even a free bet!

4. Keep an eye out for special offers. Finally, don't forget that Coral Casino also runs special offers from time to time which can give you even more value for your money. So keep an eye out for these and make sure you take advantage of them when they become available!

#  How To Turn Your Coral Casino Welcome Bonus Into Cash

Coral casino is a top-rated gambling site that offers a wide range of games, bonuses and promotions. When you sign up, you are automatically awarded a welcome bonus. However, before you can withdraw this bonus, you must fulfil the playthrough requirements. This article explains how to turn your Coral Casino welcome bonus into cash.

The first step is to make a deposit. Your welcome bonus will be automatically credited to your account once you have made your first deposit. You must then meet the playthrough requirements. The playthrough requirement is usually 35 times the amount of the bonus. So, for example, if you receive a £100 bonus, you must wager £3,500 before you can withdraw any winnings.

In order to meet the playthrough requirement, you can play any of the games available at Coral casino. However, certain games contribute more towards meeting the requirement than others. For instance, slots and scratchcards contribute 100%, while table games and blackjack only contribute 20%. Therefore, it is best to play slots and scratchcards if you want to meet the playthrough requirement quickly.

You can track your progress towards meeting the playthrough requirement by clicking on the ‘My Account’ tab and then selecting ‘ Bonus Details’ . This will show how much of the requirement has been met so far and which games have contributed most.

Once you have met the playthrough requirement, you can withdraw your winnings by clicking on the ‘Withdraw’ tab and selecting ‘Cashier’ . You will then be able to choose from a range of payment methods including debit card, credit card and PayPal. Simply enter the amount that you would like to withdraw and click on ‘Submit’ . Your winnings will be transferred to your bank account or PayPal account within 24 hours.
