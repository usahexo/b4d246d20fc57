#  How is Tombola different than other types of poker? 

Tombola is a variation of poker that is played with a deck of only 36 cards. There are no wildcards and the rank of the cards is important. The Ace is high and the Two is low. The game is usually played by two people, but it can also be played by three or four people.

The aim of the game is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game. A trick is won by the highest card in the trick. If two or more players have cards of the same rank, then the highest suit wins the trick. The first player to take 11 tricks (or more if playing with more than two players) wins the game.

Unlike regular poker, tombola does not use any jokers or wildcards. The Ace is high and the Two is low. This makes for a much simpler game, which can be learned relatively quickly.
