There are a lot of different ways to get good gear in Borderlands, but the slot machines are one of the best. Here's how to make the most of them.

1. Save your money. The slot machines can be tempting, but it's important to save up your money if you want to get the best gear.

2. Get lucky early on. The earlier you play, the better your chances of getting good loot from the machines.

3. Focus on the right machines. Not all machines are created equal - focus on the ones that have a higher chance of giving you good gear.

4. Know when to quit. If you're not getting any good gear from the machines, it might be time to walk away and try again later.

#  Make This Easy Borderlands Trick Your New Gaming Strategy 

If you're like many gamers, you've been working your way through Borderlands 2 and struggling to level up your character as fast as possible. You may have heard of a strategy called "The Insanity Cannon," which is said to be the best way to quickly power up your Vault Hunter. So what's the Insanity Cannon, and how can you use it to power up your Borderlands 2 game?

Basically, the Insanity Cannon is a method of using certain items in combination with one another to make your enemies much easier to kill. It works especially well on bosses, allowing you to take them out with ease. There are three steps to using the Insanity Cannon: 

1. Choose the right weapon and character class. The weapon you use is critical - it needs to do a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Berserker is the best character class for this because their melee attacks are incredibly powerful.

2. Equip the weapon and then activate Anarchy mode. This will give you an even bigger advantage over your enemies by doubling your damage output. 

3. Use any ammo-boosting item you have available, such as a Tediore rocket launcher or XP boost grenade. Then simply start attacking your enemies and watch them fall!

It's important to note that this strategy only works if you're playing on Normal or harder difficulties. If you're playing on Easy, then you won't get enough of a benefit from the increased damage output to make it worth your while. 

 so if you're looking for a way to speed up your Borderlands 2 gaming experience, give the Insanity Cannon a try!
