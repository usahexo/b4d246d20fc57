      		<h1 id="Cave-Raiders-Game-addiction-is-costing-the-US-billions"><a href="#Cave-Raiders-Game-addiction-is-costing-the-US-billions" class="headerlink" title="Cave Raiders Game addiction is costing the US billions!"></a>Cave Raiders Game addiction is costing the US billions!</h1><p>According to a study released by Carl V. Palmer, the president of the American Gaming Association, Americans are spending an estimated $150 billion a year on gambling – including $67 billion on casino games, $30 billion on lotteries and $23 billion on sports betting.</p>
<p>The study also found that there are nearly twice as many gamblers in the United States as there are people who play golf or go to the movies.</p>
<p>“Gambling is woven into the fabric of our society,” said Palmer.</p>
<p>The numbers are even more staggering when you take into account that problem gambling costs the US economy an estimated $5.5 billion a year in health care, criminal justice and other social costs.</p>
<p>While lotteries account for the lion’s share of gambling revenue – generating an estimated $30 billion a year – casino games are second, with Americans spending an estimated $67 billion a year on them. This is due in part to the fact that there are now more than 1,000 casinos in 41 states, compared to just 89 casinos in 19 states just 25 years ago.</p>
<p>And this figure is only going to get bigger; according to a report by H2 Gaming Capital, the global gambling market will be worth $335 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>While most people think of Las Vegas when they think of casinos, Atlantic City is actually the biggest gambling destination in the United States, with revenues of over $5 billion last year. In fact, three of the top 10 gambling destinations in the world are in the US: Las Vegas (#1), Atlantic City (#3) and Reno (#10).</p>
<h1 id="US-taxpayers-spending-millions-to-fund-gambling-addiction"><a href="#US-taxpayers-spending-millions-to-fund-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="US taxpayers spending millions to fund gambling addiction!"></a>US taxpayers spending millions to fund gambling addiction!</h1><p>The United States government is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to fund gambling addiction, a recent report has shown.</p>
<p>The report, conducted by the investigative news outlet ProPublica, has revealed that the government is spending more than $26 million on treatments for gambling addiction each year. This figure accounts for a third of all funding for addiction treatment in the US.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and one that can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. Unfortunately, however, much of the money currently being spent on treating this addiction could be more effectively allocated.</p>
<p>There are many effective ways to treat gambling addiction, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication. However, these treatments are often not available due to a shortage of qualified therapists and&#x2F;or lack of funding.</p>
<p>This is particularly frustrating given that there are many less expensive and more effective treatments available. For example, methadone maintenance therapy is an incredibly effective treatment for opioid addiction that costs just $4 per day per patient.</p>
<p>The current situation is clearly not sustainable. The government needs to find a way to better target its resources and ensure that those who need help receive it.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Costs-US-Economy-41-5-Billion-A-Year"><a href="#Gambling-Costs-US-Economy-41-5-Billion-A-Year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Costs US Economy $41.5 Billion A Year!"></a>Gambling Costs US Economy $41.5 Billion A Year!</h1><p>Casinos are a mainstay on the Las Vegas Strip and in other gambling destinations around the world, but their presence is not without cost. A recent report from the University of Oxford estimates that gambling costs the global economy $41.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal Addiction, was based on surveys of more than 150,000 people in 148 countries. It found that problem gamblers account for two-thirds of the economic impact of gambling.</p>
<p>Researchers calculated that problem gamblers lose nearly $200 billion per year, while non-problem gamblers lose $50 billion. The study also found that problem gamblers are more likely to engage in crime and to have health problems.</p>
<p>“Gambling is widely available and often seen as a victimless activity, but our research shows that it has a serious social and economic impact,” said study author Dr. Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University in England.</p>
<p>Governments should take note of these findings and consider policies to reduce the negative consequences of gambling, Griffiths said. “This would include increasing regulation of gambling, especially when it comes to online betting and casinos, as well as increasing education and awareness about the risks associated with gambling.”</p>
<p>The study’s findings are particularly relevant in light of efforts by some U.S. states to legalize online sports betting following last year’s Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice.</p>
<p>Gambling is big business in the United States. According to estimates from the American Gaming Association (AGA), Americans wagered $150 billion on legal sports bets last year – more than twice what was bet on legal sports events in 2017. And that number is expected to grow now that several states have legalized or are considering legalizing online sports betting following last year’s Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice.</p>
<p>But all that betting comes at a cost: A recent report from the University of Oxford estimates that gambling costs the global economy $41.5 billion per year. The study, published in the journal Addiction, was based on surveys of more than 150,000 people in 148 countries. It found that problem gamblers account for two-thirds of the economic impact of gambling.</p>
<p>Investigators calculated that problem gamblers lose nearly $200 billion per year, while non-problem gamblers lose $50 billion each year. The study also found that problem gamblers are more likely to engage in criminal behavior and have health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-gambling-costing-the-US-so-much-money"><a href="#Why-is-gambling-costing-the-US-so-much-money" class="headerlink" title="Why is gambling costing the US so much money?"></a>Why is gambling costing the US so much money?</h1><p>Gambling is a huge industry in the United States. It is estimated that gambling generates over $100 billion in revenue each year. However, the cost of gambling to the US economy is much higher than the revenue generated. Gambling addiction costs the US economy over $40 billion per year. This is due to the costs of crime, healthcare, and unemployment caused by gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem in the US. It is estimated that 2% of the population has a gambling addiction. This amounts to over 5 million people. Gambling addiction can lead to criminal behavior, healthcare problems, and job loss.</p>
<p>The cost of crime caused by gambling addiction is estimated to be $7 billion per year. This includes the costs of crime related to gambling addiction, such as theft and fraud, as well as crimes committed to get money to gamble with.</p>
<p>The cost of healthcare related to gambling addiction is estimated to be $4 billion per year. This includes the costs of treating physical and mental health problems caused by gambling addiction. Healthcare costs are also increased due to injuries suffered while gambling.</p>
<p>The cost of unemployment caused by gambling addiction is estimated to be $29 billion per year. This includes the costs of lost wages and benefits, as well as retraining expenses for those who have lost their jobs because of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-costing-the-US-billions-what-can-be-done"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-costing-the-US-billions-what-can-be-done" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction costing the US billions, what can be done?"></a>Gambling addiction costing the US billions, what can be done?</h1><p>Gambling addiction has been a problem in the United States for many years, costing the country billions of dollars. There are many different ways to address this problem, but it will take cooperation from everyone involved to make a difference.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious mental health disorder that affects an individual’s ability to control their gambling behavior. This can lead to negative consequences in all areas of their life, including their personal relationships, work, and financial stability.</p>
<p>The costs associated with gambling addiction are high and impact both individuals and society as a whole. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) estimates that in the United States, gambling addiction costs $5 billion each year. This includes the cost of treating individuals with gambling addiction, crime-related costs, and lost productivity from employees with gambling problems.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to address the problem of gambling addiction. One approach is to increase access to treatment services. There are also interventions that can be implemented in the community and at the individual level.</p>
<p>At the community level, there are some things that can be done to limit access to gambling opportunities. This includes limiting the number of casinos or other types of gambling venues in a given area and restricting when these venues are open. Another strategy is to provide education about the risks of gambling addiction for both adults and children.</p>
<p>Individual-level interventions include providing information about responsible gambling practices and helping people who have developed a problem with gambling to seek treatment. Treatment for gambling addiction typically includes counseling and therapy, as well as medication if needed.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem of gambling addiction will require cooperation from everyone involved – individuals with a gambling problem, their families and friends, healthcare providers, and government officials at all levels. Working together we can develop strategies to reduce the harm caused by this serious mental health disorder and help people recover from their addiction</p>
